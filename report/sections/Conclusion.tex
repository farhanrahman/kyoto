\section{Conclusion}

- weaknesses of Kyoto
- what our simulation does well
- general trend of carbon reduction
- interesting parallels with real world for our scenarios
- lack of detail in some areas, can't factor in political pressure stuff / human factors
- fundamental inaccuracies - such as costing
- we are predicting the future
- new technologies in the future

- overall we've designed a solid framework for more powerful expansion
- does encompass a significant amount of relevant complexity

\section{Learning Outcomes}

- working in a group
- coordinating strengths and weaknesses of team members
- scheduling tasks based on dependencies
- balancing workload throughout project so we're not here right now
- difficult to make us all busy all the time
- using ourselves as a common pool resource
- success using github for version control and issue tracking, especially raising issues and assigning them to specific relevant individuals
- difficulty of adapting to a new platform - learning curves, Presage2, minimal java experience, no git experience
- dealing with unfamiliar API
- group structure dissolution
