\section{Defining our model}

This section details the design decisions made regarding the modelling of the Kyoto Protocol \textsc{cpr} system and its implementation as a multi agent system. We describe the simplifications made to the Protocol, and any assumptions about the real world and economy.

\subsection{Time}

With the understanding that Presage2 uses discrete time to run its simulations, we divided time into sessions, years, and ticks. Ticks map directly to Presage2's discrete units of time. Years last for a number of ticks defined at simulation time (defaulting to 365, which maps a single tick to a day in the real world). Sessions are composed of multiple years, with a default of 10. In the Kyoto Protocol, the length of a session is mutable depending on global economic and political climate. However, we felt it was a suitable abstraction from reality to use a consistent length for sessions throughout any individual simulation.

\subsection{Energy Output}

Energy output is the simplification of a participant's productivity. The calculation of a country's energy output depends on many economic factors, which would be too complex to accurately calculate for our model. We have simplified it such that it can be calculated using only two figures: the country's carbon output, and its fossil fuel percentage, that is, the percentage of the country's total energy that comes from fossil fuels. Using these two values, we can calculate the energy output, which is the amount of carbon the country would use if all of its energy was fossil-based:

\begin{center}
energy output = carbon output / fossil fuel \%
\end{center}

\subsection{Money}

Our model requires that participants have money to be able to spend on any of the actions available to them. Cash is thus calculated as a percentage of the participant's Gross Domestic Product (\textsc{gap}). Whilst in real life, countries may wish to vary their carbon reduction budgets, we decided that the percentage dedicated to green initiatives would remain constant.

\textsc{gdp} is initially set from real world country data, and it is understood that countries need to be able to affect their \textsc{gdp} rate (growth or contraction). In real life, \textsc{gdp} rates are controlled by a large number of factors; this has been simplified in our model such that \textsc{gdp} rate is only affected by energy output.

\subsection{The Kyoto Protocol}
The Kyoto Protocol can be summarised into the following flow of actions:

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/Kyoto_4_states.png}
	\label{fig:kyoto_4_states}
\end{figure}

While we were eager to try and have our simulation model the Kyoto Protocol accurately, some changes needed to be made to discourage agents from abusing the game mechanics. For example, in a 10 year session, a participant could maximise their industry and \textsc{gdp} for the first 9 years and hence generate a large amount of fund. This could then be followed by a drastic reduction in industry to meet its target in the last year.

\begin{description}
	\item [Target Setting] \hfill \\ In the real world, targets are calculated per session for each participant. However, our model calculates the session targets for each participant, and then sets incremental, yearly targets which, if an individual country meets these targets, will ensure it meets its session target as well. This removes the potential abuse of the \textsc{gdp} functionality, since our simulated \textsc{gdp} is not externally sensitive to non-Kyoto Protocol events like \textsc{gdp} is in the real world.
	\item [Reporting] \hfill \\ Our model follows the Kyoto Protocol and reporting is done yearly.
	\item [Monitoring] \hfill \\ As per the \textsc{cpr} model, monitoring of participants should incur a cost. Every year all participants are 'taxed' a certain percentage of their \textsc{gdp} in our model, which is used to cover the cost of monitoring participants. The Kyoto Protocol does not specifically call for a tax to cover its monitoring, although the \textsc{unfccc} is funded by its members, so our model represents a suitable abstraction to reality.

In the real world, monitoring is done every 5 years by a team of experts. We decided to monitor more frequently in order to discourage unrealistic participant behaviour. A number of random participants are checked yearly using the funds gained from the 'monitor tax'. Repeat offenders, who have been found cheating before, have an increased probability of being monitored in the future.
	\item [Sanctioning] \hfill \\ Sanctions are applied immediately when participants are found to have missed targets or have reported fraudulent emissions. The sanction for missing a target is a proportional increase in that participant's target in the following year, which is in line with the Kyoto Protocol regulations.

The sanction for fraudulent reporting in real life are rather 'light weight', only suggesting a recalculation of the reported figures. In the real world, this kind of fraudulent activity would also result in political pressure from other Kyoto participants, but this would be hard to model in our simulation. We wanted to look at the effect of a more 'harsh' form of sanctioning, and thus it was decided to impose financial sanctions for fraudulent reporting.
\end{description}

\subsection{Participants \& Actions}
Countries which form part of the Kyoto Protocol have been split into 4 groups:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Annex I (Must reduce emissions -- e.g. \textsc{eu})}
	\item{Annex I (Must sustain emissions -- e.g. Russia)}
	\item{Non-Annex I (Developing countries)}
	\item{Rogue Countries (Not part of Kyoto)}
\end{itemize}

While Annex I and Non-Annex I countries have been implemented as per the Protocol specification, it was decided that we would remove the Annex II class (which is just a subset of Annex I), and allow all Annex I classes to invest in \textsc{cdm}.

Table X defined the actions which participants can use:

\subsubsection{Domestic carbon reduction measures}
\begin{description}
	\item [Carbon Absorption] \hfill \\ Carbon absorption is the process of building carbon sinks, projects which offset carbon emissions, for example planting large sections of forest. As in real life, our carbon absorption model allows for diminishing returns, so as more carbon absorption actions are taken, the return received for a given investment decreases. This models the changes in land price after extensive forestation, and the increased difficulty of building further carbon sinks as more projects are constructed. In theory, the cheaper, more efficient projects are prioritized, so once they have been completed, greater investment is required for further improvement.

Our model only allows for forestation on arable land; this differs from real life where trees can be planted on various types of land. This simplification allows us to use freely accessible country data. Another simplification is the immediate building/growing of trees; in real life, a participant would only get gradual carbon reduction gains from planting trees. However, there are mechanisms in place within the Kyoto Protocol to immediately reward member states for sustainable development projects which reduce long term emissions. Our carbon absorption system models an abstraction of these two factors combined. 
	\item [Carbon Reduction] \hfill \\ Carbon reduction is the process of reducing carbon output of dirty industry. As in real life, our carbon reduction model allows for diminishing returns. Hence as more dirty industry is upgraded to clean one, the cost of further reduction increases. This maps to the ease of upgrading from coal power to existing, but cleaner natural gas technology, when compared to the investment required to pioneer nuclear fusion research.

Our model is only affected by the percentage of total dirty industry. In real life, there are various ways in which carbon reduction can be implemented, although the simplification used is suitable for the complexity of our model.
	\item [Energy Usage] \hfill \\ As previously described, participants need to be able to have some influence over their GDP rate. In our model, energy output is a driving factor behind the GDP rate calculations, and so participants have the option of either growing or constricting their industry. This has the effect of changing the energy output and carbon output accordingly.

Investments in carbon industry will result in GDP growth, capped at sensible levels, but increases in carbon emissions. Countries who must reduce their overall emissions but wish to still maximize their economic growth must first invest in carbon industry and then in carbon reduction or absorption.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Flexibility Mechanisms}
\begin{description}
	\item [Emissions Trading] \hfill \\ In the real world, while being a viable carbon offsetting measure, carbon emission trading has proved less popular than domestic carbon reduction. Our model places more emphasis on emissions trading than in the real world, as we were interested in the simulation of an active commodities market.

It is understood that the world has several emission trading schemes and markets, the \textsc{eu ets} being one of the largest. While we did plan to incorporate the \textsc{eu ets} into our game, this was eventually scrapped as the time available did not warrant the extra complexity this would add to the simulation.
	\item [Clean Development Mechanisms] \hfill \\ \textsc{cdm} is a significant action available to participants of the Kyoto Protocol, and similar to our interest in an active carbon market, we were keen to see the effects of an active market for clean investment. This mechanism is broadly unchanged from the real world specification, with the exception that we are not differentiating between \textsc{aau}s and \textsc{car}s.
	\item [Joint Implementation] \hfill \\ The \textsc{ji} flexibility mechanism did not prove to be very popular in the real world, and with so few examples of this mechanism being carried out, it was left out of our simulation, and its inclusion would add unnecessary complexity.
\end{description}	
	
\subsection{Flowcharts}
Before moving to the coding phase of the project, some initial flow charts were drafted to help us visualise the different states and actions that would have to be implemented. The high level architecture of the simulation can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:kyoto_simulation_flowchart} with a more detailed composition of the country behaviour sub-process in Figure \ref{fig:country_behaviour_flowchart}:
