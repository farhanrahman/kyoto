UML Readme
=====

These folders contain UML diagrams for important classes in the project.

These are generated using the ObjectAid plugin, which can be found at http://www.objectaid.com

Once installed, you can add UML diagrams by New > Others > ObjectAid UML Diagram > Class Diagram. You can add java files by dragging them into the class file (*.ucls); these will be automagically
updated when the Java is updated.

You can also add relations by right clicking on the class > Add > ...

You should add whatever relations you think are needed to make the class diagram clear to others. Some classes have been added, but it is suggested that these be checked over.
