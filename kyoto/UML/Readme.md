UML Readme
=====

These folders contain UML diagrams for important classes in the project.

These are generated using the ObjectAid plugin, which can be found at http://www.objectaid.com.

This can be installed by adding *http://www.objectaid.com/update* to *Install New Software...*, and select *Class Diagram*. (NOTE: You only need to install *Class Diagram*. *Sequence Diagram* requires a license)

Once installed, you can add UML diagrams by *New > Others > ObjectAid UML Diagram > Class Diagram*. You can add java files by dragging them into the class file (*.ucls); these will be automagically updated when the Java is updated.

You can also add relations by right clicking on the class *> Add > ...*

You should add whatever relations you think are needed to make the class diagram clear to others. Some classes have been added, but it is suggested that these be checked over.
